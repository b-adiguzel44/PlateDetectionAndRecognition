# License Plate Detection and Recognition 
My project was to recognise and detect the license plates of vehicles.

I have used four models to train my own custom data:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Classification 
- Multilayer perceptron (MLP) for Image Classification
- Faster R-CNN for Object Detection
- YOLOv5 for Object Detection
